# Flume API Integration
## Overview
The Flume API Integration provides a comprehensive set of classes and methods to interact with various Flume endpoints. This integration allows developers to retrieve and manage notifications, usage alerts, devices, leak alerts, data, and authentication within the Flume environment.

## Retrieve API Key
You can find your Client ID and Client Secret under "API Access" on the [settings page](https://portal.flumewater.com/settings). These credentials are essential for interacting with the Flume API.
